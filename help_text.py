README_TEXT = ''';                         WHAT IS POOL
; So first off, what is Pool and why should I use it? Pool is a wrapper
; for tool.exe that allows you to batch process tool commands, run up to
; 64 tool commands in parallel, run tool on directories other than the
; one it resides in, and more. Pool also allows you to save the list of
; commands you've typed in to text files and load them up for later use.
; Pool will load up whatever commands were typed in when it was closed.
; Pool can do more, but it is basically an ease-of-use upgrade for tool.


;                       GETTING STARTED
; To use Pool at all, you first need to select the tool.exe to use.
; Pool will try to detect your copies of tool when it loads if none
; have been added. To add one, go to "File->Add Tool" and browse to
; the tool.exe you want to use. To switch tools, click the menu to
; the left of "Help". It will show you all tools it knows about.

; Now you're all set, and you can just type commands into this text
; box like you would normally when running tool in the command line.
; A couple useful examples can be viewed by going to "File->Open"
; and opening one of the text files in the command lists folder.


;                       HOW TO USE POOL
; Just enter commands like you would for running Tool in command line.
; Once you've typed them in, hit "Process all" or "Process selected".
; Lines starting with a ; or a / are considered disabled(they are
; basically comments), and are ignored when processing. Lines that
; begin with a # are considered directives and do special things.
; For example, #cwd allows you to set the current working directory,
; #k and #c make cmd windows stay open or close(respectively) when
; the command finishes processing, and #w tells Pool to wait until
; all commands currently processing are finished before continuing.
; Combine #k with #w and you can pause processing at certain spots.

; Commands currently processing will be surrounded in yellow, failed
; commands will be surrounded in red, and finished ones in green.
; Because Tool doesn't actually report any error information when it
; returns, the only failures Pool can detect are mis-typed commands.
; Go to "Help->Commands and Directives" to view an explaination of
; each command, each directive, and each of their arguments.
;     (NOTE: As of right now, most of the help is blank. Sorry!)


;                        SMART-ASSIST
; I personally prefer to type commands and parameters in rather than
; using a GUI(like a file browser) to do it for me. There are others
; like me, but there are also people who want/need the help. To make
; everyone happy, I've come up with a smart-assist system that works
; through the use of right-clicking. Right-click an empty line and a
; menu will pop up that allows you to paste in a template for any
; command or directive. Right-click a command to get a description
; of it and what its arguments are. Right-click an argument to view
; a description of the argument and/or bring up a GUI to edit it.
; Smart-assist can be turned off at any time in the Settings menu.
; Example:
;     Right-click the <scenario> argument of build-cache-file and a
;     browser will appear, letting you select the scenario to use.


;           THESE COLORS HURT AND I HATE THE ACTION MENUS!!!
; If you don't like the text color scheme or the commands that appear
; in the right-click menu, you can change them through the File menu.
; The color scheme and menu options will be opened in notepad, and
; will both be applied as soon as you save and close the text files.


;              WAS IT REALLY NECESSARY TO CREATE THIS?
; No, not at all lmao. I was REALLY bored and decided that it'd be
; fun to add another tool(lul) to the MEK that sort-of replaces one
; of Bungie's original hek programs. I'm not insane enough to write
; an actual REPLACEMENT for tool.exe, so this is good enough for me.

This is a small help-file to explain what each Tool command and
Pool directive does, how to use it, and what its arguments are.
To use a directive in, type a # before it(ex:  # cwd  or  #cwd).

The argument types are as follows:

    bool:   A true or false value. 0 for false, 1 for true.

    float:  A number that can have a decimal(ex: 1.337).

    int:    An integer number(cannot have a decimal point).

    str:    A string of characters such as "letters". If the
        string contains spaces, enclose the string in quotes.
        (ex: "this is a string")

    dir:    A path to a directory. Except for the cwd directive,
        any command or directive asking for a directory will need
        it to be relative to the current working directory(cwd).
        Do NOT use / to separate folders. Tool doesnt recognize
        this as a separator. Use \\ instead.

    file:   A path to a file. Any command or directive asking for
        a filepath will need it to be relative to the current
        working directory(cwd). Do NOT use / to separate folders.
        Tool doesnt recognize this as a separator. Use \\ instead.

    str-no-quote: Same as str, except it cannot be enclosed
        in quotes, and as a result cannot contain spaces.

    file-no-ext:  Same as file, except you do not provide the
        file extension. Tool will either know the extension
        already or will be able to guess it.
