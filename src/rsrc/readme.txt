The MEK(Mo's Editing Kit) Essentials is a set of tools designed for editing Halo Custom Editon on PC. These tools are Pool, Mozzarilla, and Refinery, and they supplement the editing programs provided by the HEK(Halo Editing Kit).

More detailed information on each program can be found in their readme's. You can find these readme's through the start menu.


Refinery:
	A Map extractor that can rip tags and data from any Halo 1 map for any version of Halo 1. This extractor works with Open Sauce maps, and has special features not seen in other tools.


Mozzarilla:
	A near 100% replacement for Guerilla with loads of ease-of-use upgrades for editing tags, finding bugs, and packaging tags. Mozzarilla can work with regular and Open Sauce tags, and is highly customizable.


Pool:
	A wrapper for Tool.exe with information on each tool command. Pool allows batch processing, parallel processing, saving command lists for later use, and much more.
