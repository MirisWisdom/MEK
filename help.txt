
This is a small help-file to explain what each Tool command and
Pool directive does, how to use it, and what its arguments are.
To use a directive in, type a # before it(ex:  # cwd  or  #cwd).

The argument types are as follows:

    bool:   A true or false value. 0 for false, 1 for true.

    float:  A number that can have a decimal(ex: 1.337).

    int:    An integer number(cannot have a decimal point).

    str:    A string of characters such as "letters". If the
        string contains spaces, enclose the string in quotes.
        (ex: "this is a string")

    dir:    A path to a directory. Except for the cwd directive,
        any command or directive asking for a directory will need
        it to be relative to the current working directory(cwd).
        Do NOT use / to separate folders. Tool doesnt recognize
        this as a separator. Use \ instead.

    file:   A path to a file. Any command or directive asking for
        a filepath will need it to be relative to the current
        working directory(cwd). Do NOT use / to separate folders.
        Tool doesnt recognize this as a separator. Use \ instead.

    str-no-quote: Same as str, except it cannot be enclosed
        in quotes, and as a result cannot contain spaces.

    file-no-ext:  Same as file, except you do not provide the
        file extension. Tool will either know the extension
        already or will be able to guess it.


#  DIRECTIVES

    #  ARGUMENTS
    ############
    <directory>  (dir)
        The directory to set as the current working directory.
        This is an absolute path, meaning it is not relative to anything.

  animations
    Compiles a folder of jma/jmm/jmo/jmr/jmt/jmw/jmz animations in the data folder into a model_animations tag. The directory you specify must contain these files in a folder named "animations". Do NOT type the "animations" part of the path; it is implied.
    
    Each jm* type compiles to a different type of animation. dx/dy/dz means the animation will permanently move the object in the world on that/those axis, while dyaw means it will permanently rotate the object. These are typically used for movement and turning.
    
    base (overlays be be played on it)

  hud-messages
    Compiles a "hud messages.hmt" file in the specified folder into a hud_message_text tag. The .hmt file must be saved in Unicode 16Bit encoding(not ANSI/ASCI/UTF8). Each line in the .hmt file must have the format "X=Y" where X is the message name, and Y is the message.
    
    The message name must be 31 characters or less. The entire message must be on the same line as the "X=" part. If you need to put a line break in the message, type |n instead. You can also specify a button/weapon icon to appear in part of the message using special characters. Here is a list of the icon names:
           %a-button, %b-button, %x-button, %y-button

  import-device-defaults
    My guess is that this creates a device_defaults tag from your own savegame preferences. I doubt this has realistically ever been useful to anyone other than Gearbox Software and Bungie.

    <type>  (str-no-quote)

    <savegame-path>  (file)


  import-structure-lightmap-uvs
    Replaces the lightmap UVs of a bsp with custom ones loaded from an obj file. The obj file must have lightmaps grouped by object and have the group index appending the group name (lightmap_0). Best way to ensure this is to export a fresh lightmaps obj using Aether, import it into your modelling program, and then ONLY edit the UVs to ensure the model matches the bsp.

    #  ARGUMENTS
    ############
    <structure-bsp-path>  (file-no-ext)
        Location of the target bsp, relative to the tags directory.

    <obj-file-path>  (file-no-ext)
        Location of the source obj, relative to the data directory.


  lightmaps
    Runs radiosity on the specified bsp to calculate static lighting. This process can typically take a long time at highest quality, so only run it when you have time to spare.
    
    Quick and dirty lightmaps can be calculated to allow you to quickly test changes to the level geometry. Use this command if you dont know what good testing values for your bsp are:
           lightmaps   <scenario>  <bsp-name>  0  0.1
    
    Best quality lightmaps would use these settings:
           lightmaps   <scenario>  <bsp-name>  1  0.0000001

    #  ARGUMENTS
    ############
    <scenario-path>  (file-no-ext)
        Filepath to the scenario that uses the bsp you want to light.

    <bsp-name>  (str)
        The name of the bsp to run radiosity on. This is the name of the structure_scenario_bsp tag you are running this on.

    <render-high-quality>  (bool)
        Use highest quality radiosity settings?

    <stop-threshold>  (float)
        The percentage of light remaining to stop calculating at. Light is cast in multiple passes from each surface, getting progressively finer with each pass. Each pass also reduces the total amount of light to be cast from each surface. When the amount of light remaining hits this value, radiosity will stop.


  merge-scenery
    Merges scenery instances from the source-scenario into the destination-scenario.

    #  ARGUMENTS
    ############
    <source-scenario>  (file-no-ext)
        The filepath of the scenario to copy the scenery from.

    <destination-scenario>  (file-no-ext)
        The filepath of the scenario to paste the scenery into.


  model
    Compiles a directory of .jms models in the data folder into a gbxmodel tag. The directory you specify must contain these files in a folder named "models". Do NOT type the "models" part of the path; it is implied.
    
    The name of each jms file in the "models" folder must be the permutation name that jms file contains. Here are most of the special permutation names as well as when they are used:

  sounds
    Compiles a directory of folders of .wav files in the data folder into sound tags. Each folder in the directory specified will be compiled into a sound tag. Any sub-folders within these are treated as pitch ranges. Any .wav files inside these pitch range folders are permutations within that pitch range. If you do not need to use pitch ranges, just put each .wav permutation file directly inside each sounds folder.
    
    For example, to compile the tag:
           vehicles\sophia\sounds\cannon_fire.sound
    
    you would create this audio perumtation:
           vehicles\sophia\sounds\cannon_fire\default.wav
    
    and then run the command:
           sounds  vehicles\sophia\sounds  ogg  1
    
    NOTE: All .wav data files MUST be saved with 16bit signed, little endian, PCM encoding. This is the only format that tool can read.

    #  ARGUMENTS
    ############
    <directory-name>  (dir)
        The directory containing the sounds to be compiled.

    <platform>  (str)
        The format to compile the sounds to. The xbox and wav formats are basically the same, and are the only ones that will work on an Xbox. Ogg can only be used PC, and has higher quality than the others. If you have a choice, choose xbox for short quick sounds, and ogg for music or dialog.

    <use-high-quality(ogg_only)>  (bool)
        Prioritize audio quality over filesize?

  structure
    Compiles a .jms model in the data folder into a scenario_structure_bsp (sbsp) tag. The directory you specify must contain this .jms file in a folder named "models". Do NOT type the "models" part of the path; it is implied.
    
    The name of the jms file in the "models" folder is the name the bsp it compiles to will be given. This is typically the same name as the scenario, but large levels may utilize multiple bsps.
    
    If a scenario tag doesn't already exist in the folder this sbsp tag will be compiled into, one referencing the new bsp will be created.

    #  ARGUMENTS
    ############
    <scenario-directory>  (dir)
        The directory containing the "models" folder that contains the .jms file you are compiling.

    <bsp-name>  (str)
        The name of the .jms file to compile, as well as the name to give the scenario_structure_bsp tag you are compiling.


  structure-breakable-surfaces
    Creates breakable surfaces structures in the specified structure_scenario_bsp (sbsp) tag. Each surface has a flag to specify if it is breakable. When the sbsp tag is compiled from a .jms file, the shaders determine whether to set these flags for each surface. This command will generate breakable-surface structures for each surface flagged as breakable. Surfaces will not actually break if these structures are not generated after compiling the sbsp tag.
